# Use

- for a while I was looking for a way to calculate maxes and weights for working sets when trying to plan lifts but couldn't find the right medium
- a web interface was too heavy, a mobile app was nice but I like to use my computer for real planning
- finally I realized a CLI was the best way and my end goal is to have a program that can perform simple calculations based on weights and reps to determine intensities and can take a spreadsheet as a value and make graphs based on the values presented
